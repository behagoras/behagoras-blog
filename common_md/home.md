Hey there! I'm **David Behar**, a Full Stack Developer who believes great software is about solving real-world problems—not just writing code.

I've been building web apps, mentoring dev teams, and crafting scalable solutions for over 15 years. I still genuinely celebrate every successful deploy 🚀.

## 💻 What I Actually Do

I turn ideas into software that's intuitive, scalable, and reliable:

- **Frontend:** Craft engaging UIs using `React`, `TypeScript`, and modern design systems.
- **Backend & Cloud:** Develop scalable, serverless systems with `AWS Lambda`, `Serverless Framework`, and `Node.js`.
- **DevOps & Automation:** Build efficient deployment workflows using `Jenkins`, `Azure DevOps`, and AWS tools.
- **Testing & Quality:** Guarantee reliability through `Jest`, `Cypress`, and rigorous performance checks.
- **AI & Productivity:** Accelerate prototyping and workflows with prompt engineering and generative AI.

## 🔥 Stuff I'm Proud Of

- Leading and mentoring dev teams, helping engineers grow.
- Building `micro-frontend` architectures that improved **dev experience and UX**.
- Developing backend services handling **millions** of requests with `AWS Lambda`, `API Gateway`, and the full AWS ecosystem.
- Streamlining **CI/CD pipelines**—shrinking deployments from **hours** down to **minutes**.

## 🧠 How I Work

- **Solve Real Problems:** Choose tech based on problems, not trends.
- **Code is Communication:** Write clear, readable, maintainable code. `Developer experience` matters.
- **Team Growth:** Mentor actively to build happy, productive teams.
- **Constant Learning:** Always adapting, always sharing new insights.
