## 👋 Hi, I'm David Behar

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with over 15 years of experience in the tech industry — and more than 7 of those years deeply focused on web development.

What sets me apart is how I approach problems: I select the right tool for the job, whether that’s a full web application, a serverless backend, a CLI script, or even an Excel sheet if that’s what solves it best.

I’ve worked across the stack, but specialize in:
- Building and optimizing complex user interfaces with **React**
- Designing scalable backends with **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **AWS Serverless**
- Creating **developer tools**, enhancing **CI/CD pipelines**, and improving **performance** from frontend to infrastructure

---

## 🛠️ My Experience in a Nutshell

I’ve:
- Led teams and mentored junior developers
- Delivered high-quality systems in **micro frontend architectures**
- Built scalable applications powered by **Serverless Framework**, **Lambda**, **API Gateway**, and **CloudFormation**
- Driven cross-functional solutions with **Jenkins**, **Azure DevOps**, **Auth0**, **AppSync**, and more
- Written tests with **Jest** and **Cypress** to ensure quality at every level

---

## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

I care about:
- **Solving the right problem**, not just coding for the sake of it
- **Writing clear, maintainable code** and documenting ideas so others can follow
- **Teaching and mentoring**, helping teams grow sustainably
- Using **AI tools** (like prompt engineering) to accelerate early prototyping

I take pride in my ability to move between technical depth and big-picture thinking. Whether it’s shipping code or helping stakeholders understand trade-offs, I thrive in both arenas.
