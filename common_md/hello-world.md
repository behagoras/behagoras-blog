# Here I am 🌐

After years of collecting experiences, notes, and lessons learned in software development, I'm officially ready to share publicly.

This blog is powered by **Next.js**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and structured around interconnected topics through [wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/links). It’s a practical, transparent collection of my professional journey, technical experiments, and thoughts on building effective software.

- **Tooling & Developer Experience**: CLI scripts, productivity enhancements, AI-driven prototyping.
- **Serverless & Backend Development**: AWS Lambda, Serverless Framework, infrastructure automation.
- **Architecture**: Micro frontends, monorepos, scalable system designs.

I’ll draw from real projects, personal experiments, and lessons learned.

## 💭 Why Write Now?

Simply, because It's cool, and I have a large vault around various topics, but you may want a to know my story as a developer.

I also started this because I want to give back to the community, as It has helped me a lot.
